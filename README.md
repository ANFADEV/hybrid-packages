# UPM Packages in .unitypackage files

Unity has two separate package formats:
- .unitypackage, a zip-based file format that is used on the AssetStore
- UPM packages, to prepare files for Unity's package manager.

So far, it has been impossible to ship UPM packages on AssetStore or via .unitypackages. This repository fixes that by
- allowing packages to be uploaded to the AssetStore through the regular AssetStoreTools
- enabling <kbd>Assets/Export Package</kbd> to export package folders directly
