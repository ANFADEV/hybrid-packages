# UPM Packages in .unitypackage files

![Unity Version Compatibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-2018.4%20%E2%80%94%202020.3-brightgreen)

Unity has two separate package formats:
- `.unitypackage`, a zip-based file format that is used on the Asset Store
- `UPM package`, to prepare modules for Unity's package manager.
  
The latter is newer, enforces better code and directory structure (AsmDefs required), and generally much easier to work with / add / remove / update.

So far, it has been impossible to ship UPM packages on Asset Store or via `.unitypackage` files.  
This repository fixes that by changing the directory export checks to allow assets from the Packages folder to be exported, which 
- allows packages to be uploaded to the Asset Store through the regular Asset Store Tools
- enables <kbd>Assets/Export Package</kbd> to export stuff from package folders directly

The resulting .unitypackage files _do not require any additional setup for users_.

> :warning: This is experimental. Unity will likely add some form of UPM support to AssetStore in the next years.

## Installation üíæ
1. 
    <details>
    <summary>Add OpenUPM with the <code>com.needle</code> scope to your project (this package has a dependency there)</summary>

    - open <kbd>Edit/Project Settings/Package Manager</kbd>
    - add a new Scoped Registry:
    ```
    Name: OpenUPM
    URL:  https://package.openupm.com/
    Scope(s): com.needle
    ```
    - click <kbd>Save</kbd>
    </details>
2. Add this repository as git package (it's not on OpenUPM yet)
   - open <kbd>Window/Package Manager</kbd>
   - click <kbd>+</kbd>
   - click <kbd>Add package from git URL</kbd>
   - paste `https://github.com/needle-tools/upm-in-unitypackage.git/?path=/package`
   - click <kbd>Add</kbd>

## How to use üí°

### Export a .unitypackage that contains files in Packages or entire packages
As usual, select what you want to export, and hit <kbd>Assets/Export Package</kbd> (also available via right click).  

### Upload Packages to Asset Store
1. Install the Asset Store Tools as usual: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/asset-store-tools-115
1. Open <kbd>Asset Store Tools/Package Upload</kbd>
1. Press <kbd>Select</kbd> and select a local or embedded package
2. Make sure "include dependencies" is off - you can now specify them through your package.json!
3. Press <kbd>Upload</kbd>

## Known Issues / Limitations
- The optional <kbd>Validate</kbd> step isn't supported yet. Export your package via <kbd>Right Click/Export Package</kbd> and test in a separate project for now.
- If you run into any issues, you can temporarily disable the functionality via <kbd>Edit/Project Settings/Needle/Editor Patch Manager</kbd> or remove the package. Please report a bug!
- The `package.json` of your package can [define dependencies](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html). However, only dependencies from the Unity Registry will be automatically resolved in empty projects - we'll need to think of a separate mechanism / guidance for people to add dependencies from scoped registries. For now, it's recommended that you guard against missing dependencies via [Version Defines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html#define-symbols).

## Technical Details  

This is tested with Unity 2018.4, 2019.4, 2020.3 and Asset Store Tools 5.0.4.

All the functionality to use packages in .unitypackages is already provided by Unity. Just the tooling to create them has too many incorrect/outdated safety checks - so all we're doing here is bypassing those. It's still the same Unity APIs creating / exporting / importing packages.

## If you're Unity

We're happy to provide guidance on what we needed to change here. This took only a few hours to create, and ideally wouldn't be necessary - `AssetStoreTools.dll` and `.unitypackage` utilities in Unity could just work.
